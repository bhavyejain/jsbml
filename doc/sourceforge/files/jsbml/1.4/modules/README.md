J S B M L   1.4
=====

JSBML is a free, open-source programming library to help you read, write, manipulate, translate, and validate SBML files and data streams. It is not an application itself (though it does come with example programs), but rather a library you can embed in your own applications.

This is the top-level directory of the modules for JSBML 1.4. Here you will find the following:

* [jsbml-celldesigner-1.0.zip](jsbml-celldesigner-1.0.zip)  -- distribution for the celldesigner module

* [jsbml-libSBMLio-1.0.zip](jsbml-libSBMLio-1.0.zip)  -- distribution for the libSBMLio module

* [jsbml-tidy-1.4.zip](jsbml-tidy-1.4.zip) -- distribution for the tidy module (also included in the jsbml-with-dependencies jar file)
